# 60OEC - MX & EC 60% Keyboard

Opensource 60% by Thebloodyezkb

## Introduction:
I started this project as an entry into the journey of EC case design with the idea of open-sourceing it later. The Topre keyboard is a top-mount 60% named 60OEC (yeah, the naming game...).
The idea was to make a Topre keyboard with a PC case, but due to the PC surface, I decided to add something to cover surface scratches and UV light. The topcase contains a two-part outer aluminum cover and a PC inner case.
The inner case screws to the top aluminum case, then the plate screws to the inner PC case. The inner PC case should have metal thread holes to protect the plate thread screws from damage.

I am still working on this project and I will keep maintain it if there is any changes. 
I have few things to cover that I will list them below.

to use this keyboard for fabrication with the manufactors you will need to provide the following.

## To do list:
1. Add mx plate to the repo (DXF & Step files).
2. Add WKL & HHKB (7U/6U) outer & inner top case.
3. Prototype the keyboard.

## Rectangle Info

### Compatible PCBs:
- MX Hiney 60 PCB.
- EC60 by Cipulot (Check reference link at "References" section).
- UDB.

### Parts:
- Top outer aluminum case.
- Top inner PC case.
- Bottom aluminum case.
- Through weight.
- Plate 1.2 mm (of choice).

## Fabrication Materials:
1. 60OEC Pc Top V1.step
2. 60OEC Top Case V1.pdf
3. 60OEC Bottom Case V1.pdf

## Case materials per parts as following:
1. Top case outer case (Aluminum 6063 sandblasted).
2. Top case inner case pc (PC sandblasted ask for thread support as its not been fully tested).
3. Plate (you could use FR4, steel and aluminum EC).
4. Bottom case (Aluminum 6063 sandblasted).
5. Through weight (Brass, Coppe, Stainless Steel, Etc.. sanblasted).
6. The feets uses universal 8mm rubber feet.
