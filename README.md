# The Grill 60 - MX & EC 60% Keyboard

Opensource 60% by Thebloodyezkb

## Introduction:
I started this project as an entry into the journey of EC case design with the idea of open-sourceing it later. The Topre keyboard is a top-mount 60% named 60OEC (yeah, name changed to The Grill 60).
The idea was to make a Topre keyboard with a PC case, but due to the PC surface, I decided to add something to cover surface scratches and UV light. The topcase contains a two-part outer aluminum cover and a PC inner case.
The inner case screws to the top aluminum case, then the plate screws to the inner PC case. The inner PC case should have metal thread holes to protect the plate thread screws from damage.

I am still working on this project and I will keep maintain it if there is any changes. 
I have few things to cover that I will list them below.

to use this keyboard for fabrication with the manufactors you will need to provide the following.

## To do list:
1. Add MX Plate to the repo (DXF & Step files).
2. Add WKL & HHKB (7U/6U) outer & inner top case.
3. Add an order guide for the keyboard.
