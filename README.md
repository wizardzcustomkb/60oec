# 60OEC - MX & EC 60% Keyboard

Opensource 60% by Thebloodyezkb

## Introduction:
I started this project as a test into the journy of EC case design with the idea of open source it using something new for topre keyboards here is top mount 60% 60OEC.
The idea was to make a topre keyboard with PC case but due to pc surface I dicided to add something like a cover from sirfaace scratches and UV light. The topcase contain 2 part outer aluminum cover and inner pc.
The inner case screws to top alumium case then the plate then screws to inner PC case. the inner PC case should have metal thread holes to help the plate thread screws from damage.

I am still working on this project and I will keep maintain it if there is any changes. 
I have few things to cover that I will list them below.

to use this keyboard for fabricatin with the manufactors you will need to provide the following.

## To do list:
1. Add mx plate to the repo (DXF & Step files).

## Fabrication Materials:
1. 60OEC Pc Top V1.step
2. 60OEC Top Case V1.pdf
3. 60OEC Bottom Case V1.pdf

## Case materials per parts as following:
1. Top case outer case (Aluminum 6063 sandblasted).
2. Top case inner case pc (PC sandblasted ask for thread support as its not been fully tested).
3. Plate (you could use FR4, steel and aluminum EC).
4. Bottom case (Aluminum 6063 sandblasted).
5. Through weight (Brass, Coppe, Etc.. sanblasted).
